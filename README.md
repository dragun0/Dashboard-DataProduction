# Dashboard Data Production Pipeline

This repository contains the full Python-based data preparation pipeline developed for the thesis project:

**Machine Learning vs. Physics-Based Weather Models: A Geospatial Assessment of AI‚Äôs Potential for More Accurate Weather Forecasting**  
*MSc Geoinformatics Engineering ‚Äì Politecnico di Milano*  
Author: Leonie Dragun (10776334)

The code in this repository processes raw weather forecast and reanalysis data into verification datasets used in the forecast evaluation dashboard:

## Purpose

This repository performs the fetching, preprocessing and processing of deterministic forecast data from three weather models:

- **ECMWF IFS-HRES** (Numerical Weather Prediction)
- **Google DeepMind GraphCast** (Machine Learning)
- **ECMWF AIFS** (Machine Learning)

...against the **ERA5 reanalysis** ground truth, to compute forecast error metrics (RMSE, MAE, MBE, R), and convert the results into:

- Multi-scale Zarr pyramids for interactive maps  
- Region-aggregated JSON files for time series (graphs) visualisations
